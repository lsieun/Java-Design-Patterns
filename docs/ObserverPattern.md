# Observer Pattern

Observer pattern is used when there is **one-to-many relationship** between objects such as if one object is modified, its depenedent objects are to be notified automatically. Observer pattern falls under **behavioral pattern** category.

Observer pattern uses **three actor classes**. **Subject**, **Observer** and **Client**. **Subject** is an object having methods to attach and detach **observers** to a **client** object.
